                <p>The Top Gaming Libraries & Clients Are: <br>
                    Epic Games<br>
                    Steam<br>
                    Riot Games<br>

                <div class="review-content">
                    <p>The Epic Games Store launched in December 2018 as a software client. <br>Valve Corporation released Steam on September 12, 2003.<br>
                        Riot Client first launched in 2019 with the Legends of Runeterra closed beta. <br>The Rockstar Games Launcher was released on September 17, 2019. </p>
                    <h2>Epic Games Launcher.</h2>
                    <p>The Epic Games Launcher is now using Epic Online Services natively to assist with updating, as well as keep cross-platform and social features up-to-date for integrated games.
                        With this change, the Epic Games Launcher will need to install a local Epic Online Services component as a prerequisite. Once you’ve installed the 14.2.0 Epic Games Launcher (or later) update on Windows you will begin to see messaging informing you of the changes and prompting you to complete Epic Online Services installation to receive launcher updates.                      
                        To ensure you are able to continue updating the Epic Games Launcher we recommend getting the Epic Online Services installation completed as soon as possible. This can be done in just a few short steps from the settings menu in the Epic Games Launcher detailed below.</p>
                    <h2>Steam Launcher.</h2>
                    <p>Valve has rolled out a new update for Steam that bumps up the size requirements for banner images. The changes were made to help developers "show off their game in the best light," particularly on high-res monitors and the Steam Deck OLED.
                        The OLED was further cited as the first place where the new size would be most noticeable, as the smaller sizes stood out on the updated handheld.                       
                        Under the new template, assets for the Steam store (small, header, main, and vertical capsules) and library (header) will doubled in size. New high-resolution asset usage will roll out over the next few months, while the previous sizes lose support on November 1.</p>
                    <h2>Riot Client.</h2>
                    <p>Over the last few years, we’ve finally put the ’s’ in Riot Games, and you’ve created diverse and thriving communities around Teamfight Tactics, Legends of Runterra, VALORANT, Wild Rift, and of course League of Legends. We wanted to develop a client that would give you the best experience possible and get you into your favorite desktop game quickly while also giving you the opportunity to explore all of what Riot has to offer.
                        All the Riot titles have actually already been using this multi-game client but skinned for each individual game and without a way to access your library of Riot games. We’re now adding a new user interface, streamlined features and even more on the way after launch. With the new Riot Client, it’ll be easier for you to discover and access all of what we have to offer. All desktop Riot games will be accessible from one client, with each game having its own dedicated product page with game-specific content including the latest news and events. You’ll be able to clean up your desktop and only have one Riot Client launcher where all your favorite Riot games will live! However, if you prefer, you can maintain your existing game desktop shortcuts for a direct path to your favorite game.</p>
                    <h2>Rockstar Games Launcher.</h2>
                    <p>The Rockstar Games Launcher is a new Windows desktop application that allows you to quickly and easily access your Rockstar Games PC collection in a single place, across both digital and disc-based titles including ones purchased from various other digital stores. You can also use the Launcher to shop for new Rockstar Games PC titles to add to your collection.
                        The Rockstar Games Launcher comes with a host of features including the addition of cloud save functionality to all supported titles, the ability to keep your Rockstar Games PC library updated automatically, and ways to follow all the latest Rockstar Games news from directly inside the Launcher.</p>
