                    <p>Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6), one of the most anticipated video games of all time, has left fans eagerly awaiting a second trailer since the first one dropped on December 4, 2023. The initial trailer, which has amassed nearly 221 million YouTube views, generated immense excitement and speculation, yet left many key aspects of the game shrouded in mystery. With the game’s release currently scheduled for 2025, the anticipation for further promotional material is palpable.</p>
                    <h2>News.</h2>
                    <p>Fans have speculated about several potential release dates for the highly anticipated second trailer. One fan theory centers around December 3rd, 2024, a date strategically positioned one week before the presumed launch of one of the final major updates for Grand Theft Auto Online (GTA Online) before GTA 6’s release. This theory, however, relies on unconfirmed information.<br>
                        <br>A more concrete prediction points to the 2024 Game Awards, scheduled for December 12. This prestigious industry event provides a significant platform for major game announcements and updates, making it an ideal setting for unveiling GTA 6’s next trailer.<br>
                        <br>While not dependent on the Game Awards’ publicity, the event’s timing aligns perfectly with the one-year anniversary of the first trailer’s release and the heightened anticipation surrounding the game at that point.<br><br>
                        Fans have also speculated on the trailer’s content. It suggests a shift in focus from the first trailer’s protagonist, Lucia, to Jason, the game’s other main character. This would provide a more complete picture of the game’s narrative and potentially showcase more of Vice City and other rumored locations.<br><br>
                        While a connection to the final GTA Online update is considered a possibility, the strategic advantages of a Game Awards reveal make it the more likely scenario. A 2024 release for the second trailer seems highly probable, setting the stage for a strong launch into GTA 6’s official release year.<br><br>
                        Rockstar was supposed to make a GTA 6 Trailer 2 announcement today, November 22, according to a moon theory that had sent the Grand Theft Auto community into overdrive.    
                        <br><br>A year on from Rockstar’s internet-breaking GTA 6 Trailer 1 release, information-starved fans have taken to looking at images of the moon as they hunt desperately for clues on Trailer 2.</p>
                    <h2>Trends.</h2>
                    <p>Fast forward to the start of November 2024, and Rockstar’s release of another GTA Online image, below, that - you guessed it - includes the moon in the Waning Gibbous phase. The real-life moon ends its current Waning Gibbous phase today, November 22, and from tomorrow moves on to the Last Quarter phase. And so, fans thought today would be the last possible day for either Trailer 2 itself or an announcement on when it would drop.<br><br>
                        Unfortunately for its supporters, the moon theory turned out to be wrong this time. 9am Eastern, when Rockstar’s New York-based parent company Take-Two tends to make its announcements, has been and gone without a peep.<br>
                        The GTA community is struggling to cope with this, taking to social media, Discords, and subreddits to question their world view.<br><br>
                        It is remarkable that Rockstar has gone nearly a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all. With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later. But will the moon show fans the way? Or is Rockstar just messing with its fanbase, as it’s done many times in the past?<br><br>
                        Will Rockstar delay GTA 6 out of 2025 and into 2026? It’s one of the burning questions gamers, publishers, and analysts have of what to expect from next year. In truth, only Rockstar can answer that question, but one former developer at the studio has suggested such a decision could come in pretty hot.
                        <br><br>Former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij, who IGN has reported on before after he shed light on Rockstar’s long lost game Agent’s development troubles, tweeted to provide some context on any speculation about the fate of GTA 6’s current fall 2025 release window on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S.<br><br></p>
