                <p>Published on: Initially on August 21, 2012 later revised into CS 2 on September 27, 2023</p>
                <p>Published By: Valve Corporation and their partner, Hidden Path Entertainment.</p>
                <div class="review-content">
                    <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for OS X, PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, focusing on revenue from cosmetic items.
                        The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in late 2018.</p>
                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <p>For over two decades, Counter-Strike has offered an elite competitive experience, one shaped by millions of players from across the globe. And now the next chapter in the CS story is about to begin. This is Counter-Strike 2.

                        A free upgrade to CS:GO, Counter-Strike 2 marks the largest technical leap in Counter-Strikeâ€™s history. Built on the Source 2 engine, Counter-Strike 2 is modernized with realistic physically-based rendering, state of the art networking, and upgraded Community Workshop tools.</p>
                    <h2>Graphics and Sound</h2>
                    <p>The sequel promises to contain modern graphics while retaining the classic mechanics of the original Counter-Strike. The title will also arrive this summer as a free upgrade to the existing, free-to-play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and players can bring existing legacy items they own into the new experience.</p>  
                    <h2>Story and Characters</h2>
                    <p>For 20 years, Counter-Strike players have worn generic character skins into their minutes-long matches. In-game terrorist factions like the "Phoenix Connexion" or "Elite Crew" have fought spec-ops groups like GSG-9 and the SAS. Through the immeasurable repetition of CS, these drab default outfits embedded themselves in the identity of the game. With Operation Shattered Web, that's changing.
                        "For the first time in CS:GO, unlock all-new T and CT-sided characters equippable on any map," writes Valve on a microsite announcing the update. "All-new CT Operators and T Agents are available as mission progress rewards. Complete missions and earn Stars to unlock them and equip them for deployment. Or equip the default Local Agent or Operator to use the pre-existing map-based characters."</p>
                    <h2>Verdict</h2>
                    <p>In conclusion, Game Title offers an engaging experience with its innovative gameplay mechanics and stunning visuals. While it has some minor flaws, its is very competitve making it hard for new players and the overall package is highly recommended for fans of the genre.</p>
