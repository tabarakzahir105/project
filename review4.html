                <div class="review-content">
                    <p>Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa (Ned Luke), street gangster Franklin Clinton (Shawn Fonteno), and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg), and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's open world countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.
                        The game world is navigated on foot and by vehicle, from either a third-person or first-person perspective. Players control the protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. In Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.</p>
                    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
                    <p>It turns out there's a good reason so many of GTA 5's missions take you halfway across Los Santos, and it's not just so the characters can chit chat or you can listen to the funny radio commentators.
                        Perhaps the thing Rockstar is most famous for is its open worlds. The developer manages to create virtual lands that feel alive, full of character and hidden details. They're so big that people are still discovering new things in GTA 5 to this day. Despite the size of these places, there's something to do almost everywhere, and that's a key part of their design.  
                        Speaking on the GTA VI O'clock YouTube channel, ex-Rockstar developer Ben Hinchliffe, now lead designer at Just Add Water, explains the process. "We have this huge map for these open-world games," he says. "It's meticulously planned where content takes place on the map to make sure there isn't any section of the map missing content, missing gameplay." </p>
                    <h2>Graphics and Sound</h2>
                    <p>Fan favourite GTA V graphics mod, NaturalVision Evolved, has gained significant changes. The mod makes GTA V look realistic compared to how it is when NVE isn’t being used. 2024 has seen the mod get major upgrades in January, April, July and August. This is far more than the previous year.
                        The Razed who leads development team behind the mod shared a new post on Patreon detailing the Fall 2024 update and published a trailer alongside it. This way fans can take a proper look at the updates’s new features.</p>  
                    <h2>Story and Characters</h2>
                    <p>Most video game series don't have a huge connection between its voice actors and the overall fanbase. Grand Theft Auto 5 is one title that definitely does, as many of the voice actors truly love their work in this game and the fans.Certain actors are iconic and most well-known for their roles here. Some of the voice actors are familiar faces, others have neat connections, and others are a bit unknown. All of them do a great job at voicing their characters throughout both GTA 5 and GTA Online.</p>
                    <h2>Verdict</h2>
                    <p>In conclusion, Game Title offers an engaging experience with its innovative gameplay mechanics and stunning visuals.</p>
