                    <h2>News.</h2>
                    <p>In a move that has shocked both fans and critics, Vitaly, one of Kick's most controversial streamers, has been banned from the platform again. 
                        The popular internet personality, known for his provocative content and daring streams, had amassed over 334K followers at the time of his ban, positioning him among Kick’s top creators.                       
                        Vitaly’s most talked-about content revolves around his "Catching A Predator" series, which aims to expose suspected criminals by staging confrontations. <br><br>
                        Rainbow Six Siege announced the arrival of three new streamer charms to the Steamer Charm Program. The streamers added to Rainbow Six Siege's Stream Charm Program this month are MeatyMarley, ThatOneBritt, and TitaniumRolo.
                        For those unaware, the Rainbow Six Siege Streamer Charm Program is a program "designed to celebrate and reward passionate players who support the Rainbow Six Siege community with their streams, videos, and fan art for all to enjoy," according to Ubisoft's official description. <br><br>
                        If you’ve been mindlessly scrolling through streaming services and have been feeling even less enthused than usual, you may not be entirely to blame: almost all major US streamers have been cutting their original TV output this year, according to new analysis from Variety.
                        From content monolith Netflix, which released 203 original shows in the first half of 2023 compared with 174 in H1 ‘24, to Disney+, which has halved its already-slim original TV library as it continues an apparent shift to quality over quantity, shrinkage has hit the streaming world hard. Indeed, of the 8 major streamers Variety studied from Luminate data, only Max and Peacock maintained their output level year over year.
                        All told, the number of original seasons fell 19% at the 8 streamers tracked.
                        For a while, it seemed we might float forever on an endless stream of new series, as companies competed to supply viewers who’d become accustomed to basking in the Golden Age of Television. However, the financial reality of producing content in an increasingly-competitive arena where margins are tight and churn rates are growing is becoming apparent. 
                        It’ll be interesting to see how streamers’ original show libraries stack up in the latter half of this year compared to H2 2023, when original production tallies at some major players began to reflect the effects of the extended Hollywood strikes.</p>
                    <h2>Trends.</h2>
                    <p>In a new study published in the journal Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, researchers investigated sexualized content on Twitch.tv, a livestreaming giant with a global daily viewership of 3 million. Their analysis of approximately 2,000 livestreams reveals a concerning trend: women are more frequently and intensely self-sexualizing than men, hinting at a broader pattern of ‘pornification’ in digital content to lure audiences.<br><br>
                        At least, that's what your favorite streaming services want you to do. We're entering a new era of the television business as many major streaming services, including Netflix, Max, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Peacock, try to find a way to make money and keep loyal subscribers in the increasingly crowded field of streaming TV. One strategy? Make everything old new again, and embrace the bundle.</p>
