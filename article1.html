                    <h2>Graphics and Sound</h2>
                    <p>In the morning you’ll experience immersive sounds and music from the scene you picked. Rise to sounds of the Mushroom Kingdom with Mario and friends, begin your day’s adventure with Link and Princess Zelda, or start fresh with the Inklings from Splatoon 3. And those are just some of the experiences you can wake up to!
                        That’s not all – you can also check Records*** to see how much you move around in your sleep, set an hourly chime themed to your chosen title, and change between Steady or Gentle Modes for your morning alarm. In Steady Mode, the alarm will gradually get more intense the longer you stay in bed, whereas Gentle Mode offers a more consistent intensity level. There’s also Button Mode for a more traditional, tactile “hit the snooze button” alarm clock experience. You can even use sleepy sounds to wind down with soothing music and sounds at your set bedtime.
                        Plus, if you link your Nintendo Account you can download**** scenes from the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons games via free updates when they become available. For more insight into the development of Alarmo, be sure to check out the Ask The Developers interview on the Nintendo website</p>
