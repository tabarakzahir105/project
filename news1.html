                    <p>GTA 6 release date has millions ready to book off sick with 'GTA flu'
                        You guys are sick for considering this...
                        Lewis Parker
                        Rockstar Games’ upcoming title Grand Theft Auto VI is set to cause a wave of coincidently timed sick days, according to a recent study.
                        Shout out in advance to TweakTown's Anthony Garreffa, who detailed the report from Grand Theft Auto fansite GTA Boom.
                        The study, which revealed which US states are the most excited about the upcoming game, concluded that its release will cause "an unusual increase" in folks taking time off to play the title.
                        “Given the history of significant sick day spikes during major game releases,” stated Matt Gibbs, the director of GTA Boom, “like with Rockstar's last big hit, Red Dead Redemption II, it wouldn't be surprising to see a wave of 'GTA flu' when the game launches. Employers in these high-interest states might want to prepare for an unusual increase in sick leave requests around that time.”</br></br>

                        Liquid, GamerLegion, MongolZ, FlyQuest start strong in first day of CS2 Shanghai Major Opening Stage             </br></br> The patch notes for version 9.11 of Valorant are still unknown since they will be published on the game's website once the update starts to roll out across the different regions
                        However, the developers already confirmed through X (formerly Twitter) that this patch will bring a long-awaited nerf to Neon. The duelist has been in the meta for quite some time, allowing players to run around and shoot like crazy without any good counters or penalties.    </br></br> Fortnite’s current ‘Remix’ Season has been incredibly popular, but it’s about to end. Not only is the season drawing to a close Saturday, the new Season will be the first of Chapter 6.

                    <h2>Trends.</h2>
                    <p>1. More Remakes and Reboots: </br> 
                        Like the movie industry, gaming is increasingly relying on remakes and reboots of existing franchises. </br></br>
                        2. Roblox Helps Scale Indie Gaming:</br>
                        What is new is that indie game producers now have platforms (like Steam) that allow them to easily distribute their new games. 
                        Which has led to indie games like Among Us, Rimworld and Stardew Valley becoming bestsellers. </br></br>
                        3. Triple AAA Titles Sputter: </br>
                        Many Triple AAA titles have fell far short of expectations in 2023 and so far in 2024. </br></br>
                        4. New PC Gaming Platforms Attempt to Challenge Steam: </br>
                        There are currently 1.86 billion PC gamers worldwide. 
                        Until recently, the PC gaming market was dominated by a single platform: Valve’s marketplace, Steam. 
                        Steam rose to prominence largely thanks to a first-mover advantage.
                        It was one of the first platforms to allow gamers to browse, buy, review, and play PC games in one place.</br></br>
                        5. Cloud Gaming Services Grow and Expand: </br>
                        In theory, buying a game online should be an amazing experience.
                        You can browse thousands of titles. And purchase a game instantly without needing to leave your house.
                        But in practice, buying a game online has its problems.</br></br>
                        6. Next-Gen Consoles Battle It Out:</br>
                        No list of gaming trends would be complete without discussing the next generation of consoles: Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. </br></br>
                        7. Early Access Changes the Game Development Process:</br>
                        According to research published in Empirical Software Engineering, approximately 15% of all games offered on Steam are “Early Access”. 
                        And as Early Access becomes the norm for many developers, this figure is set to grow significantly in 2024 and beyond.</p>
