                        The top technology trends in 2024 combine AR/VR technologies. These are at the forefront of immersive technology, offering groundbreaking experiences in various domains. AR overlays digital information in the real world, enhancing everyday activities like gaming, education, and retail.

                    <h2>Apple Vision Pros.</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've been waiting to test the promised wide and ultra-wide screen monitor features of Apple's VisionOS 2.2 since the Vision Pro first shipped almost a year ago. When the Release Candidate became available, I rushed to install it on my head-mounted headache generator.

                    <h2>Iphone 16 Pro Max.</h2>
                    <p>
                        The iPhone 16 series have now slowly settled into our reality. No longer "new and shiny", it's just the latest iPhone.

                        Well, not entirely. Thanks to a staggered release schedule for the Apple Intelligence features, you will be getting new and fresh features quite often over the next few months. We are now up to iOS 18.2, meaning we got the integrations for text editing and generation, AI notification summaries, call summaries, as well as smart search within Google Photos. The December update gave us Visual Intelligence, the Image Playground, and ChatGPT integration with Siri. Now, we are waiting for yet another update — iOS 18.3, possibly in March, which should tie a neat bow around the package by making Siri much smarter and capable of pulling information from multiple apps and contact informations to perform complex actions.

                    <h2>Ps 5 Pro.</h2>
                    <p>
                        I remember the first time I watched a tutorial on Blender, a 3D computer graphics software, explaining how metal surfaces have colored reflections, while nonmetal surfaces don’t. It was a fascinating art lesson and something I don’t think I ever would’ve noticed if no one had pointed it out. I felt excited to learn about such a cool, if inconsequential detail about how our world looks. While testing out Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro, I experienced that same feeling over and over again.

                       <br> Generally, video game graphics have reached the coveted point of “good enough.” When Horizon Zero Dawn came out in 2017—years before the PS5 would come out—no one thought its visuals were lacking. Far from it. Yet, when Sony released a remaster of this less-than-a-decade-old game that, arguably, no one asked for, it was … actually pretty good.
                        
                        <br>The visual comparisons between the two versions of the game highlight what “better graphics” means in the modern era. Rather than focusing on things like adding more pixels or polygons, the current flex comes from either adding more stuff to the game world or getting more frames with the visuals you have. And the PS5 Pro offers a lot more room for both. Whether that makes it worth the $700 asking price is more subjective.
