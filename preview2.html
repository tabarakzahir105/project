                        <br />This growth marks a return to an expanding market after potential stagnation or slower growth in previous years.
                        <br /><br />  PC Gaming Market:
                        <br /> The PC gaming market experienced a 3.9% year-on-year growth. This is a substantial contribution, reflecting increased consumer interest in PC gaming.
                        <br /><br /> Contributing factors could include:
                        <br />The rise of esports, which heavily rely on PC platforms.
